# Credits and Acknowledgments

Jekyll Garden wouldn't exist without the contributions of many talented developers and designers. Here's who made it possible:

## Development and Inspiration

The foundation of Jekyll Garden comes from the work of several key individuals. **[Raghuveer](https://github.com/rgvr)** created the [Simply Jekyll theme](https://github.com/rgvr/simply-jekyll) that served as the foundation for this project, providing the initial structure and design principles. **[Santosh Thottingal](https://github.com/santhoshtr)** introduced the concept of Digital Gardens and inspired the wiki-linking approach that makes Jekyll Garden unique.

The development involved several contributors who brought their expertise to different aspects. **[Asim K T](https://github.com/asimkt)** coded the base HTML structure and implemented the core Jekyll Garden functionality. **[Ershad](https://github.com/ershad)** provided invaluable help with Jekyll and Ruby development. **[Anish](https://github.com/anishsheela)** contributed JavaScript improvements and bug fixes. **[Puttalu](https://github.com/aashiks)** provided OrgMode expertise and guidance.

The **[Team Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** deserves special recognition for creating the amazing markdown-based knowledge management tool that inspired the wiki-link syntax we use throughout the theme.

## Forked and Enhanced Version

This version of the theme was significantly updated and redesigned by **[Maksym Titenko](https://github.com/titenko)**.  
The modified version is based on the original [Jekyll Garden repository](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io), and includes the following major changes:

- Completely redesigned header layout
- Light/dark theme toggle with custom JavaScript
- Dynamic site title from `_config.yml`
- Editable site logo in `/assets/img/`
- Fully responsive menu, unified across mobile and desktop
- Refactored JavaScript for theme switching and menu interaction
- Enhanced CSS styling and layout improvements
- Global search bar moved to the top and visible on all pages
- Updated base page structure and meta tags for mobile support
- Automatic date rendering in post templates and footer
- Updated `Gemfile` with recent versions and new dependencies
- New `header.css` file for better style separation
- General layout and spacing fixes for improved readability
